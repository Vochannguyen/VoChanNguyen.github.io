I'm a Master's of Data Science and Education Student at SMU.

My Data Science specialization is in Machine Learning, and my Education specialization is in STEAM design. I am currently working on my capstone project in Data Science. My case studies can be found in the navigation bar, and the video presentations are included. Additionally, my Core Clarity, Resume/CV, and Teaching can be found in the navigation bar.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, serving at church, and traveling with my lovely wife.
