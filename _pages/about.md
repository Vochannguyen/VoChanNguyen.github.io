I am a Master's of Data Science Graduate Student at SMU.

My Data Science specialty is in Machine Learning. I am currently working on my capstone project in Education. My case studies can be found in the Projects Tab, and the video presentations are included. Additionally, my Core Clarity, Resume/CV, and Teaching can be found int he navigation bar.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, serving at church, and traveling with my lovely wife.
