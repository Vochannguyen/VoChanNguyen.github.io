I am a Master's of Data Science Graduate Student at SMU.

My Data Science Track is in Machine Learning Models, where my specialty is in KNN, Naive Bayes, and Multiple Linear Regression model. My case studies can be found in the Projects Tab, and the video presentations are in the Video Presentations Tab.

My interests are playing basketball, serving at church, and traveling.
